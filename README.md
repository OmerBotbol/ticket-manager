# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 2/5 - Ticket Manager

## About my project
In this project I created a ticket manager.

The tickets are loaded from mongoDB database to backend that powered with Express library and display using React framework. Eventually I uploaded the project to the Heroku cloud and you can use it with the link down below.

2. can hide a ticket and all the hidden tickets will be count.
3. can restore all the the hidden tickets.
4. can be mark as done/undone.
5. can add new ticket.

## testing

to the built-in tests that was given to me I added:

2. a test to check to done/undone button.
